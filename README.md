# Alpha-Beta-Pruning-TicTacToe
Static implementation of Alpha-Beta Pruing on 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe 

#Description:
The 4x4 board takes arguments in the form <Board Current Position> and <Y or N>
Example: X X O X # O X O X _ _ _
For simplicity, the (1,0) position is forbidden and denoted as #. The Y or N flags tell the program whether to print the pruning traces or not.
